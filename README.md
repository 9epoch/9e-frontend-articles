# Blog Readme

Welcome to the 9epoch blog! Managing and adding new content is a breeze with our simple process. Follow the steps below to add new posts to the blog.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository.
2. Ensure you have Gatsby CLI and Node.js installed on your device.
3. Install Node Modules using "npm install".
4. Run the app locally using "gatsby develop".

## Adding a New Blog Post

1. Navigate to the `/content/blog` directory in our repository.

2. Create a new folder that directly relates to your blog post. Choose a name that succinctly represents the topic or theme of your post.

3. Inside the newly created folder, add a Markdown file (`.md`). This file will contain the content of your blog post.

4. At the top of the Markdown file, include metadata enclosed in three dashes `---`. This metadata provides essential information about your blog post. Here's an example:

    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Your Blog Post Title
    date: "2024-01-10T08:00:00.000Z"
    description: "A Brief Description of Your Exciting Blog Post"
    ---
    ```

    Replace `Your Blog Post Title` and `A Brief Description of Your Exciting Blog Post` with your actual title and description.

5. Below the metadata, write your blog post content using Markdown syntax. Feel free to include headings, lists, images, and any other elements to enhance your post.

6. Save the file and commit your changes to the repository.

## Markdown Writing Tips

- Use `#` for headings, and the number of `#` symbols determines the heading level (e.g., `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`).

- Create lists using `-` or `1.`, and indent items for nested lists.

- Embed images with `![Alt Text](image-url)`.

- To include code snippets, use triple backticks (```).

- Check out the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for more detailed syntax and formatting options.

  Gatsby's blog starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this blog boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a typical Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

1.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

1.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

1.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

1.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
